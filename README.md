I will soon be setting up guides and resources focused on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), primarily focused on Android. However, some Linux and Windows projects will be highlighted as well. Note [this caveat](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/#free-in-free-and-open-source-software-does-not-mean-free-of-cost) regarding the term "free."

Additionally, privacy and/or security will likewise be a major focus. Topics such as browser hardening and private, privacy-focused DNS services will be explored in detail.

>*For now, you can find some recommendations at [https://sundevil.bio.link/](https://sundevil.bio.link/). This information will soon be added to this website in a redesigned format.*
