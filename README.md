  We are currently developing a website featuring guides and resources dedicated to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), with a primary focus on Android. The platform will also showcase select Linux and Windows projects. Please be aware of [the distinction in the term "free."](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/#free-in-free-and-open-source-software-does-not-mean-free-of-cost)
  
  
### ðŸ’¡ Collective Knowledge

  **We acknowledge the limitations of individual-driven privacy websites and outdated lists.** With collective efforts, we strive to provide updated and diverse perspectives on privacy-focused apps and projects. While I may have initiated this project alone, I welcome and encourage contributions from the community to enhance our shared knowledge base.

  Moreover, the website will prioritize discussions on privacy and security. Detailed topics like browser hardening and private, privacy-focused DNS services will be thoroughly explored. Be sure to stay tuned for updates as we delve into these critical themes!

  >*For now, you may find some recommendations at [https://sundevil.bio.link/](https://sundevil.bio.link/). This information will soon be added to this website in a redesigned format.*
