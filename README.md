# Network Engineering Pro

I am actively developing a community that will specialize in guides and resources dedicated to Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS), with a primary focus on Android. The platform will also feature select Linux and Windows projects. It's important to note the [nuanced meaning of "free"](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) in this context.
 
* Here's a [less technical explanation](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/#free-in-free-and-open-source-software-does-not-mean-free-of-cost)

It's important to grasp this concept, as NetEng-Pro is a member of the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org). Accordingly, one of this community's primary objectives is to advance truly free software (by the [FSF/GNU's definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#fs-definition)). That said, we evaluate all available options.

Our platform will center around discussions on privacy and security, covering in-depth topics such as browser hardening and privacy-focused DNS services. Stay tuned for updates as we delve deeper into these vital themes!

## Topics of Interest
  * FLOSS apps and programs
  * App guide for Android (and potentially Linux)
  * Self-hosting guide and recommendations
  * Browser privacy & security hardening
  * Privacy-centric DNS services

## ðŸ’¡ Collective Knowledge

**Recognizing the limitations of individual-driven privacy websites and outdated lists, we are dedicated to offering a broad range of current and diverse views on privacy-centric apps and projects.** Although this project was launched independently, I wholeheartedly encourage (and expect) community input to enrich and maintain our collective knowledge base.

Individual-driven projects and lists inevitably become outdated quickly; it is my belief that effective lists and privacy documentation ***MUST*** be community-driven and maintained. I'm getting the ball rolling, but I hope you'll join me! NetEng-Pro Discussions on GitHub will serve as our collaboration platform.

*Our primary short-term objective is to curate an up-to-date list of recommended FLOSS (and occasionally notable closed-source) apps for Android users.* This list is intended as a starting point. Once complete, I anticipate that it will evolve through collaborative efforts, with the community leading Discussions and driving updates.

>*For now, you can find some recommendations at [https://sundevil.bio.link/](https://sundevil.bio.link/). This information will soon be added to this website in a redesigned format.*

## ðŸš€ About Me
 
I'm a Network Security Enginneer specializing in [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com) solutions, including PAN-OS [Next-Gen Firewalls](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os) (NGFWs) and [Panorama management server](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama).

I have dabbled with Android development for some time and have recently taken an interest in substituting free software or open source apps for commercial and/or closed-source programs.
  
Additionally, I've been exploring various self-hosted solutions and plan to provide *Best Practices* documentation for beginners, among other content.
