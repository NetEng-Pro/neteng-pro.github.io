  We are actively developing a website that will specialize in guides and resources dedicated to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), with a primary focus on Android. The platform will also feature select Linux and Windows projects. It's important to note the [nuanced meaning of "free"](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/#free-in-free-and-open-source-software-does-not-mean-free-of-cost) in this context.

  Our platform will center around discussions on privacy and security, covering in-depth topics such as browser hardening and private, privacy-focused DNS services. Stay tuned for updates as we delve deeper into these vital themes!

## Topics of Interest
  * FOSS apps and programs
  * FOSS app guide for Android
  * Browser Security & Privacy Hardening
  * Privacy-centric DNS Services

## ðŸ’¡ Collective Knowledge

  **Recognizing the limitations of individual-driven privacy websites and outdated lists, we are dedicated to offering a broad range of current and diverse views on privacy-centric apps and projects.** Although I initially launched this project independently, I wholeheartedly embrace and encourage community input to enrich our collective knowledge base.

  The distinctive feature that sets this project apart is the inclusive approach to gathering insights. *Our primary short-term objective is to curate an up-to-date list of recommended FOSS (and occasionally closed-source) apps for Android users.* Once made public, we anticipate that the list will evolve through collaborative efforts, with the community leading Discussions and driving updates.

  >*For now, you may find some recommendations at [https://sundevil.bio.link/](https://sundevil.bio.link/). This information will soon be added to this website in a redesigned format.*
