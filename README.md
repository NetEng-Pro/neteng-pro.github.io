# Network Engineering Pro

I am actively developing a community that will specialize in guides and
resources dedicated to Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS), with a
primary focus on Android. The platform will also feature select Linux and
Windows projects. It's important to note the
[nuanced meaning of "free"](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) in this
context.

- Here's a
  [less technical explanation](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/#free-in-free-and-open-source-software-does-not-mean-free-of-cost)

It's important to grasp this concept, as NetEng-Pro is a member of the
[Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org). Accordingly, one of this
community's primary objectives is to advance truly free software (by the
[FSF/GNU's definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#fs-definition)).
That said, we evaluate all available options.

Our platform will center around discussions on privacy and security, covering
in-depth topics such as browser hardening and privacy-focused DNS services. Stay
tuned for updates as we delve deeper into these vital themes!

## Topics of Interest

- FLOSS apps and programs
- App guides for Android and Linux
- Self-hosting guide and recommendations
- Browser privacy & security hardening
- Privacy-centric DNS services

## ðŸ’¡ Collective Knowledge

**Recognizing the limitations of individual-driven privacy websites and outdated
lists, we are dedicated to offering a broad range of current and diverse views
on privacy-centric apps and projects.** Although this project was launched
independently, I wholeheartedly encourage (and expect) community input to enrich
and maintain our collective knowledge base.

Individual-driven projects and lists inevitably become outdated quickly; it is
my belief that effective lists and privacy documentation **_MUST_** be
community-driven and maintained. I'm getting the ball rolling, but I hope you'll
join me! NetEng-Pro Discussions on GitHub will serve as our collaboration
platform.

_Our primary short-term objective is to curate an up-to-date list of recommended
FLOSS (and occasionally notable closed-source) apps for Android users._ This
list is intended as a starting point. Once complete, I anticipate that it will
evolve through collaborative efforts, with the community leading Discussions and
driving updates.

> _For now, you can find some recommendations at
> [https://links.neteng.pro](https://links.neteng.pro/). This information
> will soon be added to this website in a redesigned format._

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a Network Security Enginneer specializing in
[Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com) solutions, including
PAN-OS [Next-Gen Firewalls](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os) (NGFWs)
and [Panorama management server](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama).

I have dabbled with Android development for some time and have recently taken an
interest in substituting free software or open source apps for commercial and/or
closed-source programs.

Additionally, I've been exploring various self-hosted solutions and plan to
provide _Best Practices_ documentation for beginners, among other content.
