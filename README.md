We will soon be establishing guides and resources focused on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for Android, Linux, and Windows. Note [this caveat](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/#free-in-free-and-open-source-software-does-not-mean-free-of-cost) regarding the term "free."

Additionally, privacy and/or security will likewise be a major focus. Topics such as browser hardening and private, privacy-focused DNS services will be explored in detail.

>For now, you can find some recommendations at [https://sundevil.bio.link/](https://sundevil.bio.link/). This information will soon be added to this website in a redesigned format.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a network security enginneer specializing in Palo Alto Networks solutions, including PAN-OS Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFWs) and Panorama management server. I have dabbled with Android development for some time and have recently taken an interest in substituting open-source alternatives rather than commercial and/or closed-source programs.
