  We are currently developing a website featuring guides and resources dedicated to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), with a primary focus on Android. The platform will also showcase select Linux and Windows projects. Please be aware of [the distinction in the term "free."](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/#free-in-free-and-open-source-software-does-not-mean-free-of-cost)

  Moreover, the website will prioritize discussions on privacy and security. Detailed topics like browser hardening and private, privacy-focused DNS services will be thoroughly explored. Be sure to stay tuned for updates as we delve into these critical themes!


## 💡 Collective Knowledge

  **Recognizing the limitations of individual-driven privacy websites and outdated lists, we are dedicated to offering a broad range of current and diverse views on privacy-centric apps and projects. Although I initially launched this project independently, I wholeheartedly embrace and encourage community input to enrich our collective knowledge base.**

  The distinctive feature that sets this project apart is the inclusive approach to gathering insights. *Our primary short-term objective is to curate an up-to-date list of recommended FOSS (and occasionally closed-source) apps for Android users.* Once made public, we anticipate that the list will evolve through collaborative efforts, with the community leading Discussions and driving updates.

  >*For now, you may find some recommendations at [https://sundevil.bio.link/](https://sundevil.bio.link/). This information will soon be added to this website in a redesigned format.*
