## <a id="about-us">About Us</a>

NetEng-Pro advocates for **truly free software**—a distinction that goes beyond
cost. To understand the deeper meaning of “free” in this context, check out:

- [The FSF/GNU definition of free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
- [A less technical explanation](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/#free-in-free-and-open-source-software-does-not-mean-free-of-cost)

As a proud **member of the
[Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://www.fsf.org/)**, our mission is to
promote and advance software freedom, aligning with the
[FSF/GNU principles](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
and the four essential freedoms. However, we critically evaluate all available solutions to ensure the best approach for privacy, security, and user empowerment.

### <a id="focus">Our Focus Areas</a>

🔹 **Privacy & Security** – Covering topics like **browser hardening,
privacy-focused DNS services, and secure communications**  
🔹 **FLOSS Advocacy** – Encouraging ethical software choices and
community-driven development  
🔹 **Technical Discussions & Guides** – Providing in-depth resources to help
users navigate the world of open-source technology

## <a id="mission">Mission</a>

At **Network Engineering Pro (NetEng-Pro)**, we champion a better, more secure
digital world through **free and open source solutions**.

Our mission:  
1️⃣ **Advocate for Free Software & Software Freedom** – Amplifying Android and
Linux FLOSS apps.  
2️⃣ 📚 **Create Actionable Resources** – From browser hardening guides to
cybersecurity tips.

## <a id="cknow">💡 Collective Knowledge</a>

**Recognizing the limitations of individual-driven privacy websites and outdated
lists, we are dedicated to offering a broad range of current and diverse views
on privacy-centric apps and projects.** We wholeheartedly encourage (and expect)
community input to enrich and maintain our collective knowledge base.

Individual-driven projects and lists inevitably become outdated quickly; it is
our belief that effective lists and privacy documentation **_MUST_** be community-driven and maintained. [NetEng-Pro Discussions](https://discuss.neteng.pro) on GitHub will serve as our primary collaboration platform. Slack and a Stack Overflow Team are also available to community members.

&nbsp;

### Current Project

Our primary short-term objective is to curate an up-to-date list of recommended
FLOSS (and occasionally notable closed-source) apps for Android users.

> **The starting point for this project is the
> [Best-FOSS-Apps-for-Android](https://github.com/NetEng-Pro/Best-FOSS-Apps-for-Android)
> repository.**

> _The repo was forked from a now-abandoned project. Some edits have been made,
> but it needs a rewrite (the original author used a lot of foreign characters)
> and community review / input._

## <a id="about-me">🚀 About Me</a>

[<img src="img/sd311.png" width="150px" height="150px" alt="SunDevil311" />](https://github.com/SunDevil311)

I'm a Network Security Enginneer specializing in [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com) solutions, including PAN-OS [Next-Gen Firewalls](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os) (NGFWs) and [Panorama management server](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama).

With several years of experience in Android development, I have a strong passion
for integrating free and open source software (FLOSS) into my workflow. My
journey began with a desire to replace proprietary apps with open source alternatives, and ever since, I’ve been exploring and curating the best FLOSS
apps available.

Additionally, I've been exploring various self-hosted solutions and plan to
provide _Best Practices_ documentation for beginners, among other content.
